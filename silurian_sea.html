		<h2 id="content">The Vertebrates arrive</h2>
		<p>Although most marine life had been wiped out following the Ordovician-Silurian extinction event, most of the organisms that survived recovered to some extent. At the start of the Silurian period, temperatures increased in a relatively stable manner to the point that the waters on the surface were warmer than the Ordovician, though some ice sheets did remain from the extinction event. Reef communities extended to the continental borders, drawing in a wide variety of species, the most common of which were early brachiopods.</p>
		<p>The cephalopods and the eurypterids were still the top predators of these waters. It was here, in fact, that eurypterids were at their peak, with some species growing to massive sizes, ultimately becoming some of the largest arthropods of all time. The Silurian seas also saw the differentiation of different fish species. It was a productive time for many species of jawless fish. Some species, the osteostracans, had bony shields on their heads and were among the most advanced of their kind. But the biggest contribution from the Silurian Period were the first fish with jaws. This evolutionary advancement to pursue a greater abundance of prey and was a major driving force for future vertebrates. Among these were the armored fish known as placoderms, which would thrive in the following Devonian Period. Another class of fish that came around were the acanthodians, the ancestors of sharks. The ray-finned fishes also evolved during the Silurian, ultimately becoming the world's most diverse class of vertebrates. The Silurian also marked the appearance of the first lobe-finned fish, such as <i>Guiyu oreiros</i>, which was perhaps the earliest known jawed bony fish. Despite being the shortest period In the Paleozoic Era, the Silurian played a critical role in the development of marine vertebrates.</p>
