		<p>The Devonian Period contained the most biodiversity of the Paleozoic Era, most of which was in the oceans. It is often referred to as the "Age of Fish" and for good reason. The waters in this period were teeming with a huge diversity of fish species. Although ray-finned fish are the most abundant class of vertebrates today, there were only a handful of genera that existed in the Devonian. By contrast, lobe-finned fish were far more commonplace in this time than they are now. Some of these lobe-finned fish, like the coelacanth and the lungfish, have survived into the present day. Others would end up walking upon land to become the first amphibians.</p>
		<p>The Devonian also saw the rise of the first "sharks", like <i>Cladoselache</i> and <i>Stethacanthus</i>, both of which were a very common sight in these waters. But they were quite small and were not the perfect predators that exist today, and since they evolved before their differentiation from rays, they weren't really true sharks.</p>
		<p>Perhaps the most iconic fish of the Devonian were the placoderms. Having first evolved at the end of the Silurian period, the placoderms were characterized by the armored plating at the front of their bodies. Some, like <i>Bothriolepis</i>, were only about a foot long. But others, specifically <i>Dunkleosteus</i></a>, were some of the largest animals in the ocean. The size of a modern Great White Shark, the fearsome <i>Dunkleosteus</i> was the apex predator of the Devonian sea.</p>
		<p>The reefs still continued to flourish in this time period. By the middle of the period, most reefs were composed of coral, algae, and sponges. Trilobites were still present in these ecosystems, as were eurypterids, though they weren't nearly as plentiful now as they were in the preceding Silurian. The Devonian seas also saw the arrival of another group of invertebrates, the ammonites. Ammonites would go on to be one of the most successful prehistoric marine organisms, flourishing in oceans all the way to end of the Mesozoic Era. Early bivalves, like clams and oysters, were also common in this time period.</p>
