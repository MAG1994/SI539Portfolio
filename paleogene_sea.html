		<h2 id="content">The First Whales</h2>
		<p>After the extinction of the dinosaurs, mammals began to dominate the Earth and the seas were no exception. At the start of the Paleogene Period, mammals were still mostly land dwellers, but there were many semi-aquatic species that did venture into the water for food. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Only during the middle of the Paleogene Period did the first marine mammals fully come into fruition, the most prominent of which was the <i>Basilosaurus</i>. This early whale was one of the largest carnivores at the time, feeding on fish and even smaller whales such as <i>Dorudon</i>. As the years progressed, the Paleogene oceans flourished with a variety of whale species such as <i>Aegyptocetus</i>, <i>Aetiocetus</i>, and <i>Janjucetus</i>. But whales weren't the only big creatures that thrived in these oceans. The Paleogene also oversaw the evolution of many shark species, at the very end of which was a 20-meter-long monster which will be covered in the next period.
