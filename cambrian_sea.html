		<p>
		The oceans of the Cambrian Period marked the beginning of the first complex life forms on the planet. Although life first originated during the Precambrian Era, it was very simple, consisting only of an abundance of microbes and simple invertebrates, such as jellyfish. But at the dawn of the Cambrian Period, the diversity and abundance of life on Earth suddenly erupted, instantaneously transforming a virtually lifeless planet into a world flourishing with a variety of different species. Known as the Cambrian explosion, this event single-handedly led to the creation of all the animal groups that we know today, including arthropods, mollusks, and echinoderms.</p>
		<p>Although corals were present during this time period, they did not form the massive reefs like they do today; cyanobacteria and other microorganisms formed the framework of most Cambrian reefs. Nevertheless, the reefs of the Cambrian Period did serve the same purpose that modern coral reefs do: providing habitat for the majority of marine life that lived in the area.</p>
		<p>Trilobites were one of the most predominant animals in the Cambrian Period, ultimately becoming one of the most successful and widespread organisms of all time. At the top of the food chain was a giant arthropod-like creature called <i>Anomalocaris</i>, believed to be the first apex predator in existence. Other notable creatures that lived in the Cambrian included the strange-looking <i>Opabinia</i> and the spiny <i>Wiwaxia</i>. But invertebrates were not the only creatures to inhabit these waters; some of the first vertebrates also made their debuts here, such as <i>Haikouichthys</i>, believed to be the first fish. Every creature today, big and small, owes their existence to the events of the Cambrian.</p>
