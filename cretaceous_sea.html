		<p>The Cretaceous Period marked the age of when the dinosaurs were in their prime, and marine reptiles were no exception. As the largest predatory dinosaurs, like T-Rex, dominated the food chain on land, even bigger carnivores ruled beneath the waves. The ichthyosaurs vanished from the oceans, and in their place came the great mosasaurs, one of the fiercest predators of the time. These carnivores would become so successful, even the fearsome pliosaurs, like <i>Kronosaurus</i>, couldn't compete. From the coastlines, pterosaurs and seabirds dove into the sea, hunting for fish and other smaller creatures. They were joined by plesiosaurs, such as <i>Elasmosaurus</i>. And these ancient reptiles were not the only hunters in the ocean; these waters were also filled with large, voracious fish like <i>Xiphactinus</i> and sharks like <i>Cretoxyrhina</i> and <i>Squalicorax</i>.

		With so many predators lurking beneath the surface, it comes as no surprise that the waters of the Cretaceous were among the most dangerous prehistoric seas of all time. But there was more life than just these predators. The oceans were filled with a rich variety of marine creatures, such as <i>Archelon</i>, the largest sea turtle ever to exist, and <i>Tusoteuthis</i>, a massive prehistoric squid. The Cretaceous also saw the last of the ammonites, many of which grew to be the largest of their kind.

		65 million years ago, a large asteroid struck the Earth. Many scientists believe that this disaster was responsible for the extinction of, not just the dinosaurs, but also the great marine reptiles, the ammonites, and countless other marine species.
