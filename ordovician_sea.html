		<h2 id="content">Dawn of Diversity</h2>
		<p>While the Cambrian Period marked the beginning of the first complex life forms on the planet, it wasn't until the Ordovician that sea life became more diverse in regards to different species. This event, known as the Ordovician radiation, was responsible for setting a new standard in marine life. While many different factors such as high temperatures and CO<sub>2</sub> levels were responsible for this event, the results were the same: new species led to more complex food webs, and ecosystems became more specialized and indigenous to specific regions.</p>
		<p>Much like the preceding Cambrian Period, the early Ordovician was mostly dominated by trilobites and it is here that they were at the peak of their success. Many trilobites began developing unique body structures and grew to huge sizes, the largest of which was more than two feet long. The Ordovician also saw a handful of free-swimming trilobites. But trilobites weren't the only arthropods thriving in these waters; eurypterids also made their debuts here. These predators would become more commonplace in the upcoming Silurian Period and would ultimately thrive throughout the rest of the Paleozoic seas. The Ordovician also saw the rise of horseshoe crabs which would ultimately survive into modern day. The sea floor housed a rich variety of early sponges, algae, and echinoderms like prehistoric crinoids (sea lilies) and sea stars, as well as the first widespread corals. Some of the first cephalopods that evolved were the squid-like orthocones, the largest of which was <i>Cameroceras</i>, the apex predator of these waters.</p>
		<p>The Ordovician had one of the highest points of diversity in the Paleozoic Era, but a series of glaciations at the end of the period would result in catastrophic consequences for the diverse marine ecosystems. Although some small reefs would briefly revive during glacial intermissions, it wouldn't be until the Silurian period that reefs would return for good.</p>
