		<p>
		The devastating mass extinction at the end of the Permian Period marked the end of almost all the Paleozoic marine life, but it also marked the beginning of a new era: the Mesozoic. And with the arrival of the new era came new forms of life to rejuvenate a practically dead planet.  In the early Triassic period, new types of corals began to emerge, creating reef systems that, while significantly smaller, were very similar to the ones that we have today. Some of the animals that made a huge recovery were the ammonites, which evolved from one single surviving line into numerous species. The fish were a different story; because there was such little variety among the fish species, it has led scientists to believe that only a handful of families made it through the mass extinction.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Triassic Period also marked a key turning point in the story of life on Earth. The planet was now ruled by a group of animals called reptiles. Reptiles dominated everywhere. In the air, the first winged reptiles, called pterosaurs, took off into the skies. On land, the most iconic prehistoric reptiles began to evolve: the dinosaurs. While they were not much to look at during this time period, the dinosaurs would soon become the most supreme rulers of the land. The oceans were no exception. While some reptiles, like <i>Nothosaurus</i>, lived only semi-aquatic lifestyles for catching food, other reptiles had adapted to spend their entire lives underwater. They included placodonts, which hunted for crustaceans hiding beneath the sediment. The Triassic also saw the arrival of the first ichthyosaurs, such as <i>Mixosaurus</i> and <i>Shastasaurus</i>, perhaps the largest marine reptile ever to exist.
		</p>
		<p>
		At the end of the Triassic Period was another mass extinction that wiped out thousands of species of reptiles, along with many other animals. But the dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and marine reptiles would survive, ultimately becoming larger and evolving into the some of the most iconic species of the past.
